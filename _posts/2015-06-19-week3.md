# Week 3
After researching on the MCU and the HOPErf modules, the initial PCB was produced in 4 days. The MCU selected was the ATmel 328P which is the most popular one on diffrerent Arduino alternative boards. The schematic circuit was pretty much the same as Moteino has, the only difference so far is the RF module which in my design the rfm69hw was basically used while in moteino the rf module was deployed from rf12b.


It has been a long time being familair with the software Eagle which is to be used for following PCB design as well. The next step would be adding the secure device ATmel produced called ATSHA204A that can be compatible with ATmel mega 328P using now. The original PCB design still need a lot of improvements in order to be price and size optimized for building the sensor nodes. The bootloader for the ATmel mega 328P MCU should also be researched and re-implemented for intergated with intialization of ATSHA204A module.

### What have been done on PCB initial design:
##### The schematic circuit

##### The board:

In the next two weeks, the following things are to be done hopefully:
* Continue working on the "perfect" PCB design in order to fit the flexibility as well as relative price optimization purpose
* Research on the secure chip may be used on the PCB ATSHA204A module
* Research on the bootloader ATmel 328P requires and find out it the bootloader could work with the secure module
* Further research on the ATmel chip which has larger flash memory, and try to find if it is necessary to have external flash momery on PCB design or not
* Continue working on some nodejs development, transfer the simple blog building to a simple CMS

For general AVR based MCUs, there are three main series manufactured by ATmel, ATtiny, Atmega and XMEGA which corresponding to different purposes. According to the official site, the series ATtiny is mostly designed for building solutions or applications commercially with smaller size and lower power consumption that the supply voltage is only 0.7 Volts. With the promise from Atmel that this tiny size of AVR based MCU has the same performance as those larger ones, this could be a great choice regarding a solution with limitations on scale. It is also mentioned that for this tinyAVR there is no need for external in-circuit which saves more time for a commercial solution to get on sell to market. The cheapest one MCU cost around USD 0.378 in ATtiny4 family (ATTINY4-TSHR).
The power consumption (ATtiny4 / ATtiny5 / ATtiny9 / ATtiny10):

*  Active Mode: 200µA at 1MHz and 1.8V 
*  Idle Mode: 25µA at 1MHz and 1.8V 
* Power-down Mode:  < 0.1µA at 1.8V


ATmega is the series that offers more memories, Pin I/Os and etc. With the featured characteristic on building IOT solutions, the mega version of AVR is typically designed for medical or health systems. This series of AVR based MCUs cost around USD 0.83 for the cheapest ones which have 4KB flash memory. The power consumption is listed below (ATmega48PB/88PB/168PB):
* Active Mode: 0.35 mA
* Power down Mode: 0.4µA
* Power-Save Mode: 0.1µA
