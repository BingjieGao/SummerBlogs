# Week 3
After researching on the MCU and the HOPErf modules, the initial PCB was produced in 4 days. The MCU selected was the ATmel 328P which is the most popular one on diffrerent Arduino alternative boards. The schematic circuit was pretty much the same as Moteino has, the only difference so far is the RF module which in my design the rfm69hw was basically used while in moteino the rf module was deployed from rf12b.


It has been a long time being familair with the software Eagle which is to be used for following PCB design as well. The next step would be adding the secure device ATmel produced called ATSHA204A that can be compatible with ATmel mega 328P using now. The original PCB design still need a lot of improvements in order to be price and size optimized for building the sensor nodes. The bootloader for the ATmel mega 328P MCU should also be researched and re-implemented for intergated with intialization of ATSHA204A module.
